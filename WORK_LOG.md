I also thought of using a TST to save memory, but I still didn't think that it would work well. |
| November 1  | 10:00-10:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          After thinking about tries and TST's I started thinking of hashing. However, just having an array filled with hashes would not really work, because you are still using around 8 Terabytes of memory to store everthing. That's when I started thinking of having some sort of adaptable data structure that could grow or shrink based on how much information was being stored. |
| November 1  | 10:30-11:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             My previous idea was obviously inspired by arraylists, but I quickly struck it down because while there might not be 8 terabytes of data, there still probably a lot of data that will still take up even more storage in something like an arraylist. So instead of thinking of adapting or creating my own versions of existing data structures that we know, I tried thinking of brand new data structures. |

What added more to the challenge was that I also had to create a data structure that used a lot less space than a normal array. This just ended up really confusing me, and I was not really able to think of any data structure that would not use up much storage. |
| November 5  | 11:17-11:50am |                                                                                                                           Today, I started by looking back at the slides to better understand what the problem set entaled. Then, I started by creating my hashmap class and I included all the instance variables and methods mentioned on the slides. I first implemented the hash function that I used for DNA since they both use Horner's method. Then, I looked at all of the instance variables and tried to understand them a little better. For example, I realized that the variable, DEFAULT_TABLE_SIZE, should be a decently sized prime number. However, I am still having a little trouble understanding what the arrays keys and values do. |

Overall, the process of coding was pretty smooth. However, I had a pretty big bug in my add and get classes. In my get class, I realized that I had to do kind of the same thing that I did in the add class. Because in my add class, if there is a collision, I move to the next index to search for an open class. So, I accounted for that in my get class. |

So, I am going to try to improve the runtime. |
| November 10 |  9:15-9:47pm  | After trying looking for places to improve the runtime, I realized that increasing the default table size and decreasing how much of my hashmap can be filled up would increase the runtime. However, when I tried to implement these by simply updating their values, I ran into some errors. So, I first began by singling out my default table size error. It did not take me long to realize that I was missing an equals sign next to a less than sign. However, the second issue took longer. I got to a point where I realized that the problem was happening in the if statements in my add and get functions. I also figured out that there was an out of bounds exception, so I just rewrote the if statement to account for that and it worked! |
