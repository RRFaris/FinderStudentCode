| November 1 | 9:00-10:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I first began thinking about storing everything in a tree or trie, but I realized that it would still most likely take up a lot of memory, especially with a trie. I also thought of using a TST to save memory, but I still didn't think that it would work well. |

However, just having an array filled with hashes would not really work, because you are still using around 8 Terabytes of memory to store everthing. That's when I started thinking of having some sort of adaptable data structure that could grow or shrink based on how much information was being stored. |

So instead of thinking of adapting or creating my own versions of existing data structures that we know, I tried thinking of brand new data structures. |

What added more to the challenge was that I also had to create a data structure that used a lot less space than a normal array. This just ended up really confusing me, and I was not really able to think of any data structure that would not use up much storage. |
| November 5 | 11:17-11:55pm | Today, I started by looking back at the slides to better understand what the problem set entaled. Then, I started by creating my hashmap class and I included all the instance variables and methods mentioned on the slides. I first implemented the hash function that I used for DNA since they both use Horner's method. Then, I looked at all of the instance variables and tried to understand them a little better. For example, I realized that the variable, DEFAULT_TABLE_SIZE, should be a decently sized prime number. However, I am still having a little trouble understanding what the arrays keys and values do. |
